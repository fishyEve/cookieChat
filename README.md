Cookie Chat is a chat server created by three sleepy college students for a final network programming project in Fall of 2023

COOKIE CHAT SERVER INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. To run Cookie Chat's server, go to the terminal. On the command line type in: "python3 server.py <portNumber> (where port number is a valid port between 10000 - 65535)
  2. When a user is ready to shut the server down, all they need to do is hit ctrl-c on their keyboard. This command will prompt the server to shut down in five seconds.

COOKIE CHAT CLIENT INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. To run Cookie Chat's client, go to the terminal. On the command line, type in: "python3 client.py <hostname> <portNumber> (hostname is localhost on ACAD, port number is still a valid port  between 10000 - 65535)
  2. Enter a nickname. Once your nickname is validated, you're ready to start cookie chatting!
  3. Once a client is ready to disconnect, the user merely needs to hit ctrl-c on their keyboard to exit the cookie chatroom

HOW TO BUILD COOKIE CAT: 
To successfully run Cookie Chat, the server must first be started up. To start the server, simply type ./server <portnum> into the command line, the program will take EXACTLY two arguments. Once the server is on and ready, it is ready to accept client connections. To connect a client, a user needs to type ./client <servername>, <portnum>. When a client is ready to disconnect, the user merely needs to hit cntrl-C on their keyboard. When a user is ready to disconnect the server, the user needs to hit cntrl-C, and then the server will shut down in a few seconds.

PROTOCOL (section of section 8 revision of original program design document):
  * The server side will be started by running the server program with a specified port number as a command line argument. This is the syntax: python3 server.py <portNumber>
  * The client side will be started by running the client program with a specified host name and port number as command line arguments. This is the syntax: python3 client.py <hostname> <portNumber>
  * The client connects to the server, if the connection is unsuccessful, the program closes. 
  * After successful client-server connection, the user on the client side will be prompted to enter a nickname in the chat application. The client sends this nickname to the server.
  * The server reads the nickname sent by the client. If the nickname is unique, it sends 'READY' to the client, indicating the specific client is ready to enter the chat room. If the nickname is not unique, the server sends 'RETRY' to the client, to which the client will prompt the user to enter a different nickname.
  * Once a unique nickname is verified by the server, the server logs that nickname,then a string indicating that the specified client 'has joined the chat at', then the date and timestamp.
  * A user can send a message into the chat by typing it out and hitting enter. This message is sent to the server by the client. 
  * When the server recieves a message from the client, it sends that message to every client EXCEPT the client the message originates from. All recieved messages are also logged to the logfile. 
  * When a client reads a message that was pushed to them by the server, it prints that message out onto the screen for the user to read.
  * The server is always listening for messages from all connected clients. A client will ONLY read from the socket if there is data in it to be read. 
  * When a client is ready to leave the chat, they press CTRL-C. The client sends 'BYE' to the server.
  * When the server recieves 'BYE' from the client, it pushes the corresponding nickname to the client that left to all other connected clients as well as the string "has left the chat". OR When the server recieves 'BYE' from the client, it sends a message to all connected clients that states "a client has left the chat".
  * When a user is ready to shut the server down, they just hit CTRL-C. The server indicates to all connected clients that it will shut down in 5 seconds, and then it shuts down. OR when a user is ready to shut the server down they just hit CTRL-C and then the server shuts down.

THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS                                                                                                                                                                        
  The first problem the Cookie Chat team ran into was creating a proper application design before the start of the actual code development process. There was a struggle to think of all details necessary to implement in the specs for this project. With the library, there was a struggle to implment JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), as none of our group members had used it in the past and it was a whole new thing to learn. With the client, there was an issue handling how to read a message pushed to all clients EXCEPT the client that sent the message in the first place.
  With the server, there was a major issue figuring out how to fork properly such that the server could handle multiple client connections. It took four days to figure out how to properly fork and handle multiple clients connecting to the server at once, however, after that occurance, the server then ran into the issue of successfully pushing one client's message to all other connected clients. Then, finally, there was the problem of figuring out how to properly push messages to all connected clients, and for how the client to know when to read and when to write to the socket. It took us the entirety of the last week to figure this out. We decided to rewrite bits of the server and the client, and decided to cut out certain parts of the project (for example, making nicknames that were taken by a client that has disconnected avalible for another client to use).
  
STATUS                                                                                                                                                                                                  
  - If a client tries to join the chatroom at the same time as another client, and the first client is not fully verified (meaning their nickname was already taken and they need to enter a different one) the program will crash.
  - If a client leaves the chat, the nickname they selected to use will still be unavalible
  - The server does not shut down in x amount of seconds on CTRL-C. It just instantly shuts down without warning any of the clients.
