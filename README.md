# cookieChat
Cookie Chat is a chat server created by three sleepy college students for a final network programming project in Fall of 2023

HOW TO BUILD COOKIE CAT: 
To successfully run Cookie Chat, the server must first be started up. To start the server, simply type ./server <portnum> into the command line, the program will take EXACTLY two arguments. Once the server is on and ready, it is ready to accept client connections. To connect a client, a user needs to type ./client <servername>, <portnum>. When a client is ready to disconnect, the user merely needs to hit cntrl-C on their keyboard. When a user is ready to disconnect the server, the user needs to hit cntrl-C, and then the server will shut down in a few seconds.
